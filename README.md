Pennies are straightforward cryptographic coins. They are based on YaCoin and use Scrypt-Jane to encourage CPU-centric mining. They are designed to mint Proof of Stake blocks easily and encourage saving. They have no decimals and no micro or nano units--every penny is a single coin! 

Minting of shiny new pennies can be done using the Command Line Banking Virtual Teller Window within the Piggy Bank. Freshly minted coins take 25 blocks to mature. Pennies are not meant to have specific value or be keyed to a specific value in any fiat or electronic currency. Pennies are a free-market cryptocurrency and are worth simply what the market determines their worth to be. 

Due to the uniqueness of indivisibility a few interesting challenges are posed to the crypto-currency community through Pennies. How might fees work at an exchange? How does pool minting work if the block reward is 1 and it can't be broken down? Pennies are meant to be simple to use, save, and transfer for beginners--and simultaneously enable advanced crypto-currency users quick, non-nonsense interaction via Command Line Banking.

Testing
=======
Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people lots of money
